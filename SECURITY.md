## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit sensitive data** (.env files, API keys, passwords)
2. **Use environment variables** for all configuration
3. **Keep dependencies updated** - Run `npm audit` regularly
4. **Follow secure coding practices** - Input validation, output encoding
5. **Use HTTPS** in production environments
6. **Implement proper authentication** - JWT tokens, secure sessions
7. **Enable security headers** - Helmet.js is already configured
8. **Rate limiting** - Already implemented for API endpoints

### For Deployers

1. **Change all default secrets** in production
2. **Use strong passwords** (minimum 32 characters for secrets)
3. **Enable firewall rules** - Only expose necessary ports
4. **Regular backups** - Use provided backup scripts
5. **Monitor logs** - Check for suspicious activity
6. **Keep system updated** - OS, Node.js, MongoDB
7. **Use SSL/TLS certificates** - Let's Encrypt or commercial
8. **Implement intrusion detection** - Consider fail2ban or similar

All security updates will be documented in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Known Issues

### xlsx Library Vulnerability (Frontend)

**Status**: Known Issue - No Fix Available  
**Severity**: HIGH  
**CVE**: GHSA-4r6h-8v6p-xvw6, GHSA-5pgg-2g8v-p4x9

**Description**: The `xlsx` library (v0.18.5) has known vulnerabilities:
- Prototype Pollution (CVSS 7.8)
- Regular Expression Denial of Service (CVSS 7.5)

**Why Not Fixed**: The vulnerability advisories recommend upgrading to v0.19.3+ or v0.20.2+, but these versions do not exist in npm registry as of January 2026. The latest available version is 0.18.5.

**Risk Assessment**: 
- **Impact**: LOW for typical usage
- **Exploitability**: Requires malicious Excel file upload
- **Mitigation**: 
  - File upload validation implemented
  - Only trusted users can import files
  - Input sanitization in place
  - Feature is optional (ImportItems page)

**Workaround**: If you don't need Excel import functionality, you can remove the `xlsx` dependency and the ImportItems feature.

**Tracking**: We are monitoring for updates to the xlsx package and will upgrade immediately when a secure version becomes available.
